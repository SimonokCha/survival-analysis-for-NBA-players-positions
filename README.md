# survival-analysis-for-NBA-players-positions
This project uses survival analysis to examine how an NBA player's primary position (Guard, Forward, Center) influences career length. Using data from 1947â€“2025, we treat retirement as the event and account for censored cases (active players) to assess position-based differences in career longevity.
